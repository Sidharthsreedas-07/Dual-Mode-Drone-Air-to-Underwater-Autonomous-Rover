As part of a multidisciplinary capstone project, our team designed and simulated a hybrid drone system capable of navigating both air and underwater environments. The focus was on developing a MATLAB-based simulation framework to test sonar-based object detection, autonomous navigation, and environmental awareness before physical deployment.

Key Contributions & Outcomes:

1. Simulated a dual-environment drone system using MATLAB, Simulink, and Robotics System Toolbox, aligning with principles of model-based systems engineering.
2. Designed and tuned PID controllers, mode-switching logic, and motion models to ensure smooth and stable transitions between aerial flight and underwater propulsion.
3. Integrated and modelled key sensors including IMU, ultrasonic, pressure, and depth sensors for real-time decision-making and environment interaction.
4. Applied Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), Side-Scan Sonar (SSS), and Doppler Sonar techniques to detect and classify marine life such as fish and sharks using sonar signal processing.
5. Implemented A* algorithm for path planning and SLAM for obstacle avoidance, enabling autonomous exploration of a defined scanning area.
6.Developed real-time 3D visualization tools to monitor the droneâ€™s navigation path, sonar scans, and object detection performance.

 Results:

1. Achieved simulated object classification accuracy >85% using sonar signatures in varying environmental conditions.
2. Enabled complete area coverage and efficient path planning with minimal collision errors in cluttered underwater environments.
3. Built a flexible framework for testing new sensors, algorithms, and mission profiles without requiring physical hardware.
